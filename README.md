# bins

*A tool for pasting from the terminal.*

 Supports [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/), [Pastie](http://pastie.org),
 [Hastebin](http://hastebin.com/), [sprunge](http://sprunge.us/),
 and [Bitbucket snippets](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/).

## Install

**bins requires at least Rust 1.8.0.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jkcclemens/bins
cd bins
# If you don't have Rust installed:
# curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
cargo install
```

Add `$HOME/.cargo/bin` to your `$PATH` or move `$HOME/.cargo/bin/bins` to `/usr/local/bin`.

### x11/clipboard (Linux-only)

If you are in an environment without `x11`, use `cargo install --no-default-features` to disable clipboard support for
bins. If clipboard support is enabled, which it is by default, your build will fail without `x11`!

## Upgrade

To upgrade an existing installation:

```
cd bins
git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master
cargo uninstall bins
cargo install
```

## Usage

To get help, use `bins -h`. bins accepts a list of multiple files, a string, or piped data.

Take a look at some of the written examples below:

### Examples

#### Creating a paste from stdin

```shell
$ echo "testing123" | bins -s gist
https://gist.github.com/fa772739e946eefdd082547ed1ec9d2c
```

#### Creating pastes from files

Pasting a single file:

```
$ bins -s gist hello.c
https://gist.github.com/215883b109a0047fe07f5ee229de6a51
```

bins supports pasting multiple files, too. With services such as GitHub's [gist](https://gist.github.com), these are natively supported. For services which don't support multiple file pastes, an index paste is created and returned which links to individual pastes for each file.

```
$ bins -s gist hello.c goodbye.c 
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7348da5d3f1cd8134d7cd6ee1cf5e84d
```

```
$ bins -s pastie hello.c goodbye.c
http://pastie.org/private/v9enoe4qbxgh6ivlazxmaa
```

#### Specifying visibility options

By default, bins will use the `defaults.private` option from the config file to determine whether or not to create a private paste. The default value of this is `true` - so new pastes will be private for a fresh install. You can override this at the command line:

```
$ bins --public -s gist hello.c 
https://gist.github.com/05285845622e5d6164f0d36b73685b19
```

### Configuration

Running bins at least once will generate a configuration file. Its location is dependent on the environment that bins is
run in. The configuration file will be created at the first available location in the list below:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/bins.cfg`
- `$HOME/.config/bins.cfg`
- `$HOME/.bins.cfg`

If none of these paths are available (`$XDG_CONFIG_DIR` and `$HOME` are either both unset or unwritable), bins will fail
and not generate a config file.

The configuration file is documented when it is generated, so check the file for configuration documentation.
